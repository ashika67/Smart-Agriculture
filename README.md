🌱 Smart Agriculture Production Optimizing Engine

Week 1 Submission (30%)

📌 Project Overview

The Smart Agriculture Production Optimizing Engine is a machine learning project for agriculture that aims to enhance farming efficiency using AI-driven crop prediction and data analysis.

This project uses agricultural datasets containing essential soil and weather parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The target is to predict the most suitable crop for given conditions.

By applying Data Science and AI in agriculture, the project contributes to:

🌾 Increasing crop yield

💧 Optimizing water and fertilizer usage

🌍 Supporting sustainable farming practices

🤖 Using AI to solve global food security challenges

📊 Dataset Details

The dataset includes:

Features (Inputs):

N → Nitrogen content in soil

P → Phosphorus content in soil

K → Potassium content in soil

temperature → in °C

humidity → in %

ph → soil acidity/alkalinity level

rainfall → in mm


Target (Output):

label → Crop type (e.g., rice, maize, coffee, cotton, pulses, etc.)

This makes it a multi-class classification problem in agriculture.

🔎 Week 1 Progress

✔️ Uploaded dataset (archive.zip) and extracted CSV file
✔️ Verified dataset shape, columns, and first rows
✔️ Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Visualized:

🌾 Crop Distribution (bar chart of crop labels)

🔗 Feature Correlation Heatmap (numerical features only)

📈 Visual Outputs

🌾 Crop Distribution

A bar chart showing the number of samples per crop type. Helps in identifying dataset balance.

🔗 Feature Correlation Heatmap

A heatmap displaying correlations between soil nutrients, temperature, rainfall, pH, and humidity. Helps in understanding relationships between agricultural parameters.
